# Systematic Conservation Planning framework to achieve 30% biodiversity protection of the mexican Exclusive Economic Zone.


A systematic marine spatial planning (Margules & Pressey 2000) that involves prioritization processes that would identify networks of conservation areas inside the mexican EEZ, to optimize the protection of marine biodiversity, minimize the effects on fishing, and thereby increasing economic benefits for coastal communities.

The spatial planning and optimization process will be achieved using the ProritizR package. (Hanson et al. 2021a; Hanson et al. 2021b; Burbano-Girón et al. 2022).

Three types of data are necessary to use Proritizr: 1) planning units, 2) costs, and 3) conservation variables (Hanson et al. 2021a).

Planning units correspond to a 0.1 x 0.1° gird of the EEZ (available at: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/al9fu9rnid0m0tobx3gcg/h?dl=0&rlkey=ps6yejqq232bcggi1ar1ckkhf).


Within this analysis three cost scenarios are assumed:

1. Prioritization of planning units represent equal monitoring costs (Net implentation cost = 0)

2. Planning units increase their implementation costs as their distance to nearest port.

3. Planning units with higher fishing effort represent higher costs.



Conservation features used in this analysis can be found within this repository or in this dropbox folder (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4oopoixzm93et9qbyr2se/h?dl=0&rlkey=9luymnd6xt33ts4eh74st7u58).
